## Conda environment
From the general python package sanity perspective, it is a good idea to use conda environments to make sure packages from different projects do not interfere with each other.


To create a conda env with python3, one runs 
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate meta-koopman

# Update: Meta-traning part

Run train_meta.py
